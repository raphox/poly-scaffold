# API RESTful

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP. RESTful APIs are defined by a set of constraints such as uniform interface, statelessness, cacheability, client-server architecture, and layered system.

### Creating a RESTful API

- [Laravel](backend-laravel)
- [Ruby on Rails](backend-ruby-on-rails)
- [Express.js](backend-express)
- [Django](backend-django)

### Creating a client to consume a RESTful API

- [Next.js](frontend-nextjs)
- [Nuxt](frontend-nuxt)

### Using Poly Scaffold to Consume a RESTful API

Poly Scaffold can be used to generate the necessary frontend code to consume a RESTful API. For example, to scaffold a Next.js application that consumes a `Post` resource, you can run:

```bash
pscaffold post title:string description:string content:text -t ./
```

This command will generate the necessary components, pages, and services to interact with the `Post` API.

## Why Use Poly Scaffold

Poly Scaffold is similar to the Rails scaffold, providing best practices and boilerplate code for new projects. Here are some reasons to use Poly Scaffold:

- **Consistency**: Ensures that your project structure and code follow consistent patterns, making it easier to maintain and scale.
- **Speed**: Quickly generates the necessary files and folders, saving you time on setup and allowing you to focus on writing business logic.
- **Best Practices**: Incorporates industry best practices into the generated code, helping you to follow standards and avoid common pitfalls.
- **Code Quality**: Generates clean, readable code that is easy to understand and modify, improving the overall quality of your project.
- **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks such as file creation and configuration, reducing the chance of human error and increasing productivity.
- **Learning**: Provides a structured way to learn new frameworks and technologies by generating boilerplate code and examples. Learn by doing! Learn by example! Learn based on best practices from the community!
- **Customization**: Allows you to customize templates and configurations to fit your specific needs, providing flexibility while maintaining structure.
- **Framework Support**: Supports multiple frameworks, making it a versatile tool for different types of projects.
