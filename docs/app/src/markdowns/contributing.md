## Improviments

### Improve the documentation

If you are interested in improving the documentation, you can do so by editing the markdown files in the `docs/app/src/markdowns` directory.

As a expert in ony of the supported frameworks, you can help us improve the documentation by adding more details about the framework, its templates, and dependencies.

### Improve the existing code

If you have any ideas on how to improve the existing code, you can do so by editing the files in the `src` directory.

You can add more features, improve the existing ones, or fix any bugs you find. You can also add support for new frameworks or libraries.

## New Frameworks

If you want to add support for a new framework, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Create a new directory in the `frameworks` directory with the name of the framework.
2. Add a `dependencies.ts` file to the new directory with the dependencies required by the framework.
3. Add an `index.ts` file to the new directory with the logic to scaffold the files for the framework.
4. Add a `templates` directory to the new directory with the templates for the files to be scaffolded.
